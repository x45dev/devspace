# FILE: .devcontainer/.env
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This file defines environment variables for the devcontainer. It serves as the
# single source of truth for configuring the container's build and runtime. 
#
# NOTE: This file is dynamically managed by `.devcontainer/scripts/initialize.sh`.

# --- Dynamically Managed Variables ---
UID=1000
GID=1000
USERNAME=x45
GROUPNAME=x45

# --- Runtime-only Variables ---

# WHY: This variable specifies to SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) that the provider for
# the AGE encryption key is a simple file on disk. This is in contrast to other
# potential providers like cloud key management services (KMS) or hardware
# security modules (HSM).
AGE_KEY_PROVIDER=file

# WHY: This variable tells sops and our bootstrap scripts where to find the AGE key. 
# This path is the canonical location where the host-side `initialize.sh` script
# places the key, and it gets mounted into the container. By defining it here,
# all components (mise, sops, our scripts) have a single, unambiguous source of truth.
SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename:-devspace}/.devcontainer/runtime/age.key [cite: 7]

# --- Host-specific Variables (used by scripts or docker-compose) ---

# WHY: This variable is a placeholder intended to be populated by the host-side
# `initialize.sh` script.  It holds the actual content of the AGE private key,
# allowing it to be securely handled and written to the `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE` path
# inside the container's build or runtime environment. It is empty by default
# for security. 
AGE_PRIVATE_KEY=

# WHY: This variable is used by host-side scripts to locate the user's GnuPG
# directory. This allows for tasks like mounting the GPG socket and keys into
# the container, enabling git commit signing or other cryptographic operations
# from within the devcontainer.
