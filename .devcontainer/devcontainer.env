# FILE: devcontainer.env
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This file defines environment variables for the devcontainer. It serves as the
# single source of truth for configuring the container's build and runtime.
#
# NOTE: This file is dynamically managed by `.devcontainer/scripts/initialize.sh`.

AGE_KEY_PROVIDER=file

#
# WHY: This variable tells sops and our bootstrap scripts where to find the AGE key.
# This path is the canonical location where the host-side `initialize.sh` script
# places the key, and it gets mounted into the container. By defining it here,
# all components (mise, sops, our scripts) have a single, unambiguous source of truth.
