# Gemini Agent Instructions

This file is the entry point for the Gemini AI agent.

Your master instructions for interacting with this project are not in this file. Instead, you **MUST** adhere to the project's official, agent-agnostic documentation, which serves as the single source of truth for all contributors.

Your process is as follows:

1.  Start by reading the [**`README.md`**](../../README.md) to get a high-level overview of the project.
2.  Your complete development workflow is defined in [**`docs/01_CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md`**](../../docs/01_CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md). You **MUST** follow this workflow for every task.
3.  The immutable principles and protocols you must follow during the workflow are defined in the [**`docs/00_PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md`**](../../docs/00_PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md).
