- Automated test suite using BATS to validate core devcontainer functionality.
- Automatic configuration of Git user details and GitHub CLI authentication from environment variables in `post-create.sh`.
- `.devcontainer/scripts/bootstrap.sh` to provide a robust, manual setup script for key generation.
- `ADR-003` to document the decision for a manual, script-first bootstrap process.

### Changed
- Refactored the initial bootstrap process to use a manual script (`bootstrap.sh`) instead of a fully automated hook, resolving a critical setup sequencing issue.
- Updated `README.md` with the new, correct Quick Start instructions.
- Clarified the scope of `ADR-001` to cover only non-interactive, pre-build setup.

Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` and project initiation workflow to reference the integrated guidance.

### Removed
- **`docs/adr-vs-spec.md`:** Removed this standalone document to eliminate documentation duplication and ambiguity, with all content integrated into core governance documents.

### Changed
- **Centralized Template Management:** Moved GitHub templates from `.github/` directory to `docs/templates/` for consistency with project governance structure. Updated `FEATURE_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` references in `PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Created `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` and symlinks to point GitHub UI to centralized templates.

### Added
