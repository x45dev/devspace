## 1. Objective

To define the functional requirements for the project's task runner and tool management system, ensuring that all project scripts and developer actions are centralized, consistent, and easily extensible.

## 2. Background

To provide a unified developer experience, all common tasks such as linting, testing, building, and managing secrets should be exposed as simple, memorable commands. Using Mise as a centralized task runner and tool manager provides a single source of truth for these commands and for the project's toolchain. This specification details the required behavior for how Mise is configured and how developers can add new tools and tasks.

## 3. Functional Requirements

*   **FR-1:** Mise **MUST** be the designated tool for managing the project's toolchain (e.g., Node.js, Python versions) and for running tasks.
*   **FR-2:** Tool versions **MUST** be defined declaratively in the `.config/mise/config.toml` file.
*   **FR-3:** Project tasks **MUST** be defined in the `.config/mise/tasks.toml` file.
*   **FR-4:** The system **MUST** provide a set of pre-configured tasks for common actions, including linting, testing (stubs), and secret management.
*   **FR-5:** The system **MUST** provide a mechanism for creating tasks that use temporary tools via wrappers like `npx` or `uv run`/`uvx`.
*   **FR-6:** All task scripts **MUST** have access to a common set of helper functions for logging and environment setup.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Usability:** Task names **SHOULD** be intuitive and follow a `group:action` convention (e.g., `lint:sh`, `secrets:edit`).
*   **Discoverability:** Developers **MUST** be able to see a list of all available tasks and their descriptions by running `mise run`.
*   **Performance:** The overhead for running a simple task (e.g., one that echoes a message) **MUST** be less than 200ms.

## 5. Error Handling

*   **Condition:** A task dependency is not met (e.g., a required tool is not defined in `config.toml`).
    *   **System Response:** Mise **MUST** fail with a clear error message indicating the missing dependency.
*   **Condition:** A script executed by a task fails (returns a non-zero exit code).
    *   **System Response:** The task **MUST** fail, and the non-zero exit code **MUST** be propagated. If the task is part of a dependency chain, the chain **MUST** be halted.

## 6. Out of Scope / Future Considerations

*   This specification does not mandate a specific set of linters or tools, only the mechanism for running them.
*   Advanced task features like parallel execution are not explicitly configured but may be available through Mise's capabilities.
