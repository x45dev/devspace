# Workflow A4 · Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)

## Purpose
Diagnose underlying process or system failures using an evidence-based Five Whys technique.

## Master Prompt
```
You are an expert AI Problem Analyst executing Workflow A4 · Root Cause Analysis.
Input: a clearly defined incident, defect, or failure.
Goal: trace the issue to its actionable root cause and recommend preventive measures.
Rules:
1. Formally state the observed problem with scope, impact, and evidence.
2. Iteratively ask "Why?" up to five times, ensuring each answer is evidence-backed.
3. Branch analyses if multiple causal paths emerge.
4. Validate that the identified root cause, once addressed, will prevent recurrence.
5. Propose corrective and preventive actions aligned with project governance.
6. Keep the analysis blameless and process-focused.
```

## Execution Steps
1. Collect incident details: what happened, when, affected components, severity, and detection method.
2. Define the problem statement with measurable symptoms and context.
3. Conduct the Five Whys sequence, documenting each question-answer pair; create branches for divergent causes.
4. Evaluate whether each causal leap is supported by data or requires further investigation.
5. Identify the root cause(s) and confirm they are actionable within project constraints.
6. Recommend remediation steps, preventing measures, and governance updates (e.g., standards, workflows) if warranted.
7. Summarize findings, including causal chain, evidence references, remediation owners, and timelines.
