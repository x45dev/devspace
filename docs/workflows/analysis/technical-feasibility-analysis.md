# Workflow: Technical Feasibility Analysis

Evaluate the proposed PLAN for technical risk, constraints, and readiness.

## Steps

1. Inputs: SPEC, PLAN draft, relevant ADRs, Code Discovery findings.
2. Dependencies: Identify external tools, services, libraries, and internal modules.
3. Risks: Performance, security, complexity, unknowns; propose mitigation.
4. Alternatives: Briefly evaluate viable alternatives and trade-offs.
5. Verification: Define how success will be measured and tested.
6. Outcome: Confirm feasibility or update PLAN/ADRs accordingly.

## Checkpoints

- [ ] Feasibility confirmed or updated PLAN produced
- [ ] Risks documented with mitigations
- [ ] Verification approach defined
