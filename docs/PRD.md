# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Dev Environment Template

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Active

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the **AI-Powered Dev Environment Template**. This product is a Git repository that serves as a feature-complete, production-ready starting point for new software projects.

It is designed for developers and teams who want to leverage AI agents in their development process. It solves the critical problem of environment setup and consistency by providing a "clone-and-run" experience that is fully automated and pre-configured with industry best practices.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to accelerate the initial phases of software development by providing a robust, replicable, and AI-ready development environment.

*   **Goal 1: Zero-Friction Onboarding:** Enable a developer to go from `git clone` to a fully running, authenticated, and productive environment in under 5 minutes.
*   **Goal 2: AI-First Workflow:** Provide a highly structured, documentation-first development workflow that is explicitly designed to be understood and executed by AI coding agents.
*   **Goal 3: Production-Ready Foundation:** Equip the template with best practices for security, testing, and automation from day one.

## 3. User Personas

*   **The AI Agent:** An automated agent that needs a clear, unambiguous, and context-rich environment to perform development tasks.
*   **The Senior Developer / Architect:** A developer who sets up and customizes the project, defines the architecture, and oversees the AI agents.
*   **The Contributor:** A developer (human or AI) who joins the project and needs to become productive as quickly as possible.

## 4. Features and Requirements

### 4.1 Feature 1: Automated Dev Environment

*   **User Story:** As a Developer, I want to open the project in a devcontainer and have the entire toolchain and environment automatically configured, so that I can start coding immediately.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   The project MUST use a Docker-based devcontainer.
    *   The environment MUST manage toolchains via Mise.
    *   The environment MUST manage secrets via SOPS + Age.
    *   File permissions between the host and container MUST be handled automatically.

### 4.2 Feature 2: AI-Ready Documentation Workflow

*   **User Story:** As an AI Agent, I want a clear document hierarchy and a step-by-step workflow to follow, so that I can understand my tasks and execute them without ambiguity.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   The project MUST have a `00_PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md` defining the core principles.
    *   The project MUST have a `01_CONTRIBUTOR_GUIDE.md` defining the development workflow.    *   The project MUST provide templates for all key documents (`PRD`, `SPEC`, `PLAN`, `ADR`, `TASK_DECOMPOSITION`).

### 4.3 Feature 3: Integrated Quality Gates

*   **User Story:** As an Architect, I want to ensure that all code meets quality standards, so I need automated checks for linting and testing.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   The project MUST provide pre-configured tasks for running linters.
    *   The project MUST provide a framework and pre-configured tasks for running automated tests.

## 5. Out of Scope

*   This project is a **template** and is language/framework agnostic. It will not include specific application logic.
*   This project will not provide opinions on specific deployment strategies (e.g., Kubernetes, serverless), but will provide a clean foundation for any strategy to be implemented.

## 6. Assumptions and Dependencies

*   Users (human or AI) are expected to have access to a host machine with Docker, VS Code (or another devcontainer-compatible editor), and Git installed.
*   The core workflow relies on the `mise`, `sops`, and `age` command-line tools being available within the devcontainer.
