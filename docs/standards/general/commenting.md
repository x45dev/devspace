## Content

### General Principles

- **Clarity and Conciseness**: Comments should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- **Explain 'Why', not 'What'**: Comments should explain the reasoning behind the code, not just what the code does. The code itself should be self-explanatory.
- **Avoid Redundant Comments**: Do not comment on code that is already clear and self-documenting.

### Comment Style

- **Consistent Style**: Use a consistent style for comments throughout the project.
- **Block Comments**: Use block comments to provide a high-level overview of a module, class, or complex function.
- **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments sparingly to clarify specific lines of code.

### TODO Comments

- **Standard Format**: Use a standard format for `TODO` comments, including a reference to the person or issue associated with the task.
  - Example: `# TODO(username): Refactor this function to improve performance.`
