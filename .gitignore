# WHY: Ignore plaintext environment files. The `.config/env` file is for local, non-sensitive
# overrides and should not be in source control. The `.env.yaml` is the temporary plaintext
# version of secrets before encryption.

.config/env/.env.yaml

#
# WHY: The encrypted secrets file should generally NOT be ignored, as it's designed to be
# safely committed to the repository. However, in a public template, we ignore it to
# prevent accidental commits of placeholder secrets. You may want to remove this line
# in your own private projects.
