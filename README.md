# AI-First Development Environment

This repository is a highly structured template for building software in a collaborative environment of humans and AI agents. It combines a fully automated, containerized development environment with a rigorous, issue-driven, Design-First workflow.

**The goal of this project is to provide a production-ready foundation for building high-quality software with maximum clarity and efficiency.**

## The Methodology

This template is built on a core philosophy: **design before you build**. The workflow is designed to ensure that every piece of work is thoroughly planned and documented before implementation begins. This is crucial for effective collaboration with AI agents, who require clear, context-rich instructions.

To understand the full methodology and how to use this template, you **MUST** begin by reading the documentation suite.

## Getting Started

This template provides a comprehensive workflow for software development. Your starting point depends on what stage you are at.

### Starting a New Project

If you have a completed Product Requirements Document (`PRD.md`) and want to begin a new project, your first step is to follow the [**Project Initiation Workflow**](docs/workflows/project-initiation.md). This will guide you through decomposing your PRD into a backlog of actionable work items.

### Contributing to an Existing Project

If you are a developer joining an existing project, your starting point is the main [**Contributor Workflow**](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). This will guide you through the process of picking up an issue and developing a feature.
